                    men
                    celebrated it as part of an observance of Catholic practice. The date of the first celebration of

                    masks in
                    the streets on Mardi Gras took place. They were sometimes prohibited by law, and were quickly
                    renewed
                    whenever such restrictions were lifted or enforcement waned. In 1833 Bernard Xavier de Marigny de
                    Mandeville, a rich plantation owner of French descent, raised money to fund an official Mardi Gras
                    celebration.

                    In 1723, the capital of Louisiana was moved to New Orleans, founded in 1718. The first Mardi
                    Gras parade held
                    in New Orleans is recorded to have taken place in 1837. The tradition in New Orleans expanded to the
                    point that it
                    became synonymous with the city in popular perception, and embraced by residents of New Orleans
                    beyond those of
                    French or Catholic heritage. Mardi Gras celebrations are part of the basis of the slogan Laissez les

            <div class="box-one">
                LaToya Cantrell (born April 3, 1972) is an American politician serving as the Mayor of New Orleans,
                Louisiana, a post
                she has held since May 7, 2018. Cantrell, a Democrat, is the first woman to hold the post. Before
                becoming mayor,
                Cantrell represented District B on the New Orleans City Council from 2012–2018.

                Cantrell was inaugurated as mayor on May 7, 2018, the first woman to hold the position in the city's
                history. Once in
                office, she established a new Office of Youth and Families, with the goal of creating a strategic
                plan to address
                families in crisis in the city. Cantrell also founded a Gun Violence Reduction Council, tasked with
                finding solutions to
                violent crime.
