## About

Hi there!
This is my first project, a mini-website with 5 pages.
On the first page, you can see a slider of images, a pop-up window, and meet the sponsors of this carnival.  
On the second page, you need to read about the history of the festival and recognize the Mayor of New Orleans.
On the next page, you need to hover over the images to see their effect. Moreover, it is recommended to watch the three videos that illustrate the parade.
On the fourth page, there are common questions and answers. The next page will show a contact form and the location of the city. On the last page, I have made a little quiz about this carnival.
This website is fully responsive.
